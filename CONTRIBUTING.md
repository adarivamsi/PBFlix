Submitting Pull Requests
Pull requests are welcomed! We'd like to review the design and implementation as early as possible so please submit the pull request even if it's not 100%. Let us know the purpose of the change and list the remaining items which need to be addressed before merging. Finally, PR's should include unit tests and documentation where appropriate.
